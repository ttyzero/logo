## ttyZero logo

About the logo:

The Logo was created by Pomke (2018) using Inkscape and GIMP. 
The ttyZero Logo is clearly a homage to the [BASH logo](https://github.com/odb/official-bash-logo) and as such is made available under the [Free Art License](http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/).

## APNG

The ttyZero logo is designed to be rendered as an APNG (Animated PNG Image) 
and images found in the /assets directory ending in `_animated.png` have been 
generated in this file format using the GIMP.
